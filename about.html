<h2 class="section-heading">The Person Behind The Name</h2>

<p>
    Hi! I'm Max, a Computer Science student from Poland, currently studying at the AGH 
    University of Science and Technology.
</p>

<p>
    My IT-related interests include the general area 
    of Machine Learning (especially neural networks used in solving problems regarding 
    computer vision and natural language processing) as well as a little bit of game 
    development.

<h2 class="section-heading">Technologies I Use</h2>
<p>
    I code my ML projects in Python, using libraries such as Tensorflow with Keras, ScikitLearn, 
    PyTorch, Pandas and Numpy; when it comes to game development, I'm a big fan of PyGame. 
    Apart from Python, I'm familiar with C, C++, HTML+CSS and a bit of JS.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Projects & Goals</h2>
<p>
    I'm currently working on a beer-themed roguelike with a team of AGH colleagues. As a 
    personal project, I'm attempting to write a real-time face recognition software using 
    CNN architecture. Check out my finished and ongoing projects on <a href="https://github.com/worthy11">
    my GitHub profile!</a>
</p>

<p>
    My short-term goals include learning to use technologies such as OpenCV, Docker and 
    Kubernetes. I'm also looking forward to taking part in some Kaggle competitions in 
    order to get familiar with the concept of exploratory data analysis when constructing 
    Machine Learning models.

<h2 class="section-heading">Collab With Me!</h2>
<p>
    I'm open to collaborative work, so if you'd like to have me on board simply let me 
    know via Discord (worthy_11) or e-mail (slotamax15@gmail.com).
