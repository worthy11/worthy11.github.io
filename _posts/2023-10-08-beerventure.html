    Beerventure is a Python project centered around the best beverage humanity ever 
    created. It's a 2D, pixelart-style game, based on classic roguelike principles: exploring an 
    endless dungeon, fighting enormous waves containg various types of enemies and seeking 
    the most favourable attacks' upgreades. The unusual theme is close to the developers' 
    hearts - we've all got a part of a beer-loving, sleep-deprived university student inside 
    of us.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Gameplay</h2>
<h3 class="section-heading">Progress & Upgrades</h3>
<p>
    The player can acquire XP and, occasionally, items, from slain enemies. While an in-game 
    shop provides a way to spend the collected experience to increase health, attack damage 
    or player speed, a crafting system allows for combining the dropped goodies into powerful 
    potions.
</p>

<p>
    The game's goal is to survive for 10 minutes. Every two and a half minutes a boss will 
    spawn, causing the timer to pause while an epic battle takes place. After its defeat, the 
    boss drops an additional upgrade for the player to collect. Every minute and fifteen 
    seconds the enemies grow stronger, granting slightly more XP upon their death.
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Combat</h3>
<p>
    The player can damage the enemies using one of three types of attacks:
    <ul>
        <li>The Slash (Szarża Żubra) - damage groups of opponents standing directly in 
            your path. (BASE ATTACK)
        </li>
        <li>
            The Spin (Okołocim) - great for dealing with opponents coming from multiple 
            directions at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Bomb (Łap Harnasia) - throw a beer bomb to eliminate your opponents from 
            a safe distance.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Enemies</h3>
<p>
    The player can encounter the following enemies:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Moiras of intoxication - spawn in groups of three. They are small, but fast, 
            gremlin-looking and extremely annoying. Their main form of attack is waves 
            that slow a player down due to massive hangover. They're common and easy to 
            defeat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Teetotaller - very serious, looks like this one corporate rat. Its main advantage 
            is being resistant to most types of beer. It attacks with disadvantages of beer 
            (slowness, nausea, other common effects). Drops vodka.
        </li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="section-heading">Bosses</h3>
<p>
    The following bosses will need to be defeated in order to advance:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Papa Vodka - the russian equivalent of Santa Claus, except drunk and gifting 
            Vodka instead of gifts. For those beerdrinkers naughty enough, he inflicts 
            them with their worst nightmare: being fully surrounded by vodka, with nowhere 
            to run.
        </li>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/02_vod1.png" alt="Results">
        <span class="caption text-muted">Papa Vodka</span>
        <li>
            Dionysus - god of wine (main opponent of beer). In opposition to archetype, it's 
            quite sophisticated-looking. Likes huge, empty spaces. Drops grape.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bourbonchaun - a scheming gnome, who took a wrong turn in his life now keeping 
            bourbon at the end of the rainbow instead of his gold. Ironically his main weapon 
            is his prefered drink, which after an attack remain on the ground for some time.
        </li>
    </ul>
